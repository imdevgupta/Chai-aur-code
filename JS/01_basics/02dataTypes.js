// alert(3+3); We are using nodejs not browsers

// We have Premitive and Non-Premitive datatypes

/*Premitive Data Type
1. Number : when we assgin integer value to the variable
2. String : Everything inside ouble quoted ("") is string
3. Boolean : Simple true or false is boolean type 
4. symbol : When we have identify uniqueness mostly used in React
5. null : we intensionally give variable a null 
6. Undefined: When we declare a variable but don't assign any value to it.

// To check the Type of Variable we have typeof to check the type of variable 

console.log(typeof 3);
console.log(typeof "Dev");
console.log(typeof false);
console.log(typeof undefined);
console.log(typeof null); // This is intesiting gives object which can be called as bug in JS
